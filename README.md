-# Analyzing-multilingual-tweets-using-langid-and-spacy

In this project i tries to analyze multilingual data after extrating it from twitter.
I have used 'langid' and 'spacy' librabries for this task.
At the end the result shows the percentage of different languages present in the dataset.
Languages are distinguished using ISO 639-1 code.
